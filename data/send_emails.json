Eventually, almost all the hospitals signed up for his App then income began to flow in. \r\n\r\nNot only was Philip making millions from his creation, but all the hospitals in the country and abroad also wanted to work with him because he wasn't like all the other doctors; he had something different to offer to the medical world. \r\n\r\nThanks to Philip's parents!!!\r\n\r\nSo, as a parent, would you want to set a fight between your children and the economy, or would you want to make your child a winner before the war even starts?\r\n\r\nJust like how Philip's parents did for him, would you also want your child to beat the economy and create something that would give him millions in his profession?\r\n\r\nIf yes, then lets chat on how you can get started with: \r\n\r\n* Skills that school would never teach your kids, \r\n* Morden skills that will make them future billionaires.\r\n* Skills that would secure them brighter future. \r\n\r\n[Click here to schedule a free call now.](https://instincthub.com/calls/30/)", "attach_file": null, "schedule": null, "timestamp": "2021-11-27T04:07:13.123000+01:00", "lead_contact_email": []}, {"id": 2, "email_from": "Noah Olatoye <nolatoye@instincthub.com>", "email_to": "all", "email_subject": "Your kid is tired of your gifts!!", "slug": "your-kid-is-tired-of-your-gifts", "description": "The Perfect Christmas Gift for Your Children Would Be?? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt's Christmas already, and other parents are thinking of the right Christmas gift for their children; what about you, would your kids feel happy if they don't get any gift from you? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWell, let's say you already have something in mind for your children, but let us guess, is it a toy?

Then, you will understand what influences your decision-making process; every second, minute and hour. \r\n\r\nThe idea here is to help you gain control of these brain sections going forward.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala is a collection of almond-shaped cells located near the base of the brain. Everyone has two cell groups in each hemisphere (or side) of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe amygdalae help to define and regulate emotions. They also preserve memories and attach them to specific feelings (happy, sad, joyous). You can refer to these as emotional remembrances.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala is part of the brain's limbic system. A limbic system is a group of complex, interconnected structures within the brain that are responsible for a person's emotional and behavioural responses.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala also activates the fight-or-flight response.\r\n\r\nThis response can help people in immediate physical danger react quickly for their safety and security. For example, the fight-or-flight response helped early humans respond to threats to avoid being injured or killed.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala activates this fight-or-flight response without any initiative from you. So when that part of your brain senses danger, it signals your brain to pump stress hormones, which prepares the body to fight for survival or flee to safety.\r\n\r\nIn these present circumstances, the fight-or-flight reaction is more likely to be activated by emotions such as anxiety, fear, attack, and anger.\r\n\r\nThe Frontal lobes\r\nOften, we call the amygdala \"reflect actions\"; you don't control it. It happens automatically. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the front lobes allow you to evaluate your emotions and then consciously respond to your experiences and judgment. These responses are not automatic, unlike the ones provoked by the amygdala.\r\n\r\nThe frontal lobes are located in the brain's cerebral cortex.

Then, you will understand what influences your decision-making process; every second, minute and hour. \r\n\r\nThe idea here is to help you gain control of these brain sections going forward.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala is a collection of almond-shaped cells located near the base of the brain. Everyone has two cell groups in each hemisphere (or side) of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe amygdalae help to define and regulate emotions. They also preserve memories and attach them to specific feelings (happy, sad, joyous). You can refer to these as emotional remembrances.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala is part of the brain's limbic system. A limbic system is a group of complex, interconnected structures within the brain that are responsible for a person's emotional and behavioural responses.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala also activates the fight-or-flight response.\r\n\r\nThis response can help people in immediate physical danger react quickly for their safety and security. For example, the fight-or-flight response helped early humans respond to threats to avoid being injured or killed.\r\n\r\nThe amygdala activates this fight-or-flight response without any initiative from you. So when that part of your brain senses danger, it signals your brain to pump stress hormones, which prepares the body to fight for survival or flee to safety.\r\n\r\nIn these present circumstances, the fight-or-flight reaction is more likely to be activated by emotions such as anxiety, fear, attack, and anger.\r\n\r\nThe Frontal lobes\r\nOften, we call the amygdala \"reflect actions\"; you don't control it. It happens automatically. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the front lobes allow you to evaluate your emotions and then consciously respond to your experiences and judgment. These responses are not automatic, unlike the ones provoked by the amygdala.\r\n\r\nThe frontal lobes are located in the brain's cerebral cortex. This brain area regulates voluntary actions like reasoning, thinking, movement, decision-making, and planning. Unlike the amygdala, the frontal lobes are more rational in processing information.\r\n\r\nWhen faced with physical threats, the amygdala automatically jumps to the fight-or-flight response, but the front lobes process the information you're receiving to help you determine if the danger is real. \r\n\r\nConversely, if the threat isn't immediate, the frontal lobes help you decide what to do in response to the stress.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when you react angrily or emotionally and later feel embarrassed and regretful, know that your amygdala is at work. \r\n\r\nBut how can you teach your brain to restrain these auto actions and leverage the frontal lobes from taking rational decisions?\r\n\r\nWatch out for my following email. \r\n\r\nDon't take this as a usual thing. \r\n\r\nNurturing the brain is the best gift anyone can ever have.

Pay them for their A\u2019s and worship at the altar of grades. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d instead like your kids to remain curious and hungry for mastery, here are some tips for re-orienting kids\u2019 priorities.\r\n\r\n### 1. Keep report cards off social media and the refrigerator: \r\nWe can tell our kids that we value learning all we want, but when we gush over grades and stick them to the refrigerator, we show them that what we love most are the grades. \r\n\r\nOf course, most parents are stuck with grades, even if they are flawed and incomplete indicators of learning and what\u2019s known as an \u201cextrinsic motivator,\u201d which has been shown to reduce motivation over the long term, undermine creativity, and encourage creativity cheating. \r\n\r\nSome schools have moved away from letter-based grades and use reports focused on mastery- or standards-based evaluations to help parents and kids focus on what\u2019s being learned rather than a grade. \r\n\r\nNo matter what kind of report your child gets, humble-bragging about it on social media only feeds parental competition;\r\n\r\nIt raises the pressure for kids and teaches them that your love and approval are contingent on their report card content. \r\n\r\nLet us continue tomorrow on their process to get a good grade (watch out for my mail). \r\n\r\n\r\nSchedule a free 30 minutes strategy session with one of my team.\r\n\r\nWe will show you exactly the steps you need to take.

Wrong learning approach:** this is very common; imagine learning to drift a car when you've not learned how to drive on a typical street or highway!\r\n\r\nImagine the frustration this kind of approach will bring!\r\n\r\nTo learn car drifting, you must learn how to drive and perfect your driving for several months before considering drifting.\r\n\r\nEvery new skill has its fundamentals. Never underestimate foundation knowledge. They are the building blocks for every perfection.\r\n\r\nIndividuals who lack patience or learn the wrong way often get frustrated and quit after this experience.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n*instincthub.com - creating technologies that allow users to learn seamlessly, prepare new job opportunities, track progress, compete with other learners and share progress with prospective.*", "attach_file": null, "schedule": null, "timestamp": "2022-09-09T10:27:59.146000+01:00", "lead_contact_email": []}, {"id": 189, "email_from": "The Sterling Academy <skills@instincthub.com>", "email_to": "iLEARN2-1", "email_subject": "iLEARN2.1 - Wrapping up WEEK 8", "slug": "ilearn2-1-wrapping-up-week-8", "description": "Dear {{first_name}},\r\n\r\nBy now, you should be more familiar with Javascript.\r\n\r\nThis Saturday, we will be taking a look at `conditional statements`.\r\n\r\nConditional statements control behaviour in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.\r\n\r\nWhen you write code, you often want to perform different actions for different decisions.\r\n\r\nLet us meet tomorrow morning to discover new things.

Web development\r\nWeb development in simple English is the process of building and maintaining a website for the internet that is accessed through a web browser. \r\n\r\nAs a web developer, your job is mainly to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. \r\n\r\nIn web development there are two aspects of web development: \r\n\r\n- Front-end: This is the part of the web you see on the browser\r\n- Back-end: This is the part of the website you don't see; it deals with a lot of the logic and functionality. Remember the restaurant description in the book? \r\n\r\n### 2. Mobile Development \r\nThis is one of the last decade's most popular forms of coding. \r\n\r\nThis is because you can't do without apps on your mobile phone. Imagine having a phone, and there are no apps on it?? \r\n\r\nBoring right?? \r\n\r\nNow you know why these skills are relevant. \r\n\r\nThere are two main categories of mobile devices, which are: \r\niOS\r\nAndroid\r\n\r\nAre you excited about the boundless opportunities hovering around tech?\r\n\r\nIf your answer is yes, let us discuss how you can begin a tech career in 12 weeks.

Web developers always fall into one of these three categories: \r\n\r\n### 1. Front-end web developers: \r\nThink of these individuals as the people in charge of an eatery's open space. The customers can buy food and decide to eat there or request a takeaway. \r\n\r\nThe front-end developers work on the visual part of the website - the pages people interact with. They design the layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the site's interactivity.\r\n\r\n### 2. Back-end web developers: \r\nThink of these individuals as the people in charge of an eatery's kitchen. They do the behind-the-seen work to ensure the food is appealing, edible and delicious. \r\n\r\nBack-end developers make sure the users and business data are properly managed. They create structure and logic that communicate with the front-end and other third parties applications.\r\n\r\n### 3. Full-stack developer: \r\nThese individuals do the work of the chef in an eatery kitchen and that of the people in charge of the open space.\r\n\r\nThey do the work of both a back-end and front-end developer. These developers know and can implement all it takes to build an entire web application.  \r\n\r\nInterestingly {{first_name}}, you could be one of these great individuals! \r\n\r\nLet us discuss how you can begin a tech career in 12 weeks.

Achieving success is beyond having enough money in your bank account. It requires lots of conscious discipline and determination.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about Elon Musk (the world's richest man) to understand better what I'm saying here. When he was 17, he took on a boiler cleaning job. \r\n\r\nIt was an awful job that paid well cause no one else wanted to do it. He did extra shifts. On top of that, he worked out how to spend as little as possible. Yet, Elon keeps his head straight and focuses on becoming more valuable. \r\n\r\nThe over 270 billion dollars richest man used to live on 1 dollar (less than N100 then) a day and shower at the YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) when working on his first business. At the same time, he slept under his desk, paying the lowest rent possible. \r\n\r\nTry read more about him {{first_name}}.\r\n\r\nSuccess is not cheap, and it is not for the weak. Instead, success is for those ready to chew glasses (Elon's metaphor).\r\n\r\nSuccess is for people ready to do strange things.

Web development\r\nWeb development in simple English is the process of building and maintaining a website for the internet that is accessed through a web browser. \r\n\r\nAs a web developer, your job is mainly to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. \r\n\r\nIn web development there are two aspects of web development: \r\n\r\n- Front-end: This is the part of the web you see on the browser\r\n\r\n- Back-end: This is the part of the website you don't see; it deals with a lot of the logic and functionality. Remember the restaurant description in the book? \r\n\r\n### 2. Mobile Development \r\nThis is one of the last decade's most popular forms of coding. \r\n\r\nThis is because you can't do without apps on your mobile phone. Imagine having a phone, and there are no apps on it?? \r\n\r\nBoring right?? \r\n\r\nNow you know why these skills are relevant. \r\n\r\nThere are two main categories of mobile devices, which are: \r\n\r\n- iOS\r\n\r\n- Android\r\n\r\nAre you excited about the boundless opportunities hovering around tech?\r\n\r\nIf your answer is yes, let us discuss how you can begin a tech career in 12 weeks.

Jason was so keen on getting into medical school. But, not just any school, he dreamt of gaining admission into Harvard.\r\n\r\nJason had just finished a quiz on this faithful day, and the teacher scored him 80/100. As a grade A student, Jason felt embarrassed, angry, and believed the teacher wanted to jeopardise his career. As a result, he brought a kitchen to the school the next day.\r\n\r\nGetting to school, he confronted his teacher (at the front of the lab). It didn't take long before Jason brought out the knife and stabbed the teacher in the collarbone before being subdued by other students.\r\n\r\nThe teacher took the matter to court!

And only went to the teacher to express the difficulty he was facing; he was going to harm himself. The teacher, on the other hand, has a different narration. \r\n\r\nHe claimed Jason was utterly aware of his action to hurt him with the knife he brought from home just because he wasn't satisfied with the bad grade.\r\n\r\n### The judge found Jason innocent!\r\n\r\nAn expert hired by the defence testified that the wound near Pologruto's collarbone was consistent with Jason's assertion. But Pologruto testified that the student had lunged at him from behind the physics lab. As a result, he had to wrestle the knife from the student to avoid being more severely injured.\r\n\r\nFive psychologists and psychiatrists appointed by the prosecution and defence agreed that Jason was psychotic at the time of the stabbing.\r\n\r\nJason changed his school to the American Heritage School. He took fewer courses but continued taking advanced courses, raising his grade point average to 4.614. Perfect scores in regular classes would result in a 4.0 average.\r\n\r\nTo date, Pologruto still struggles to make sense of what happened. In 1992, the story was published in [New York Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/23/us/student-who-stabbed-teacher-has-a-warning.html)\r\n\r\n\"Jason never even admitted that he did anything,\" he said. \"The only thing he said was, 'I'm sorry you got hurt in my suicide attempt.' \"\r\n\r\nThe question is, how could someone this intelligent do something so horrible?

But, whenever these individuals get their visas, it is good news. However, from a business owner's perspective, it is one man down. \r\n\r\nI was talking to some young and a few older people, and I could sense from their responses that they see their future in another man's country. \r\n\r\nIn fact, just this month, over three people in my circle left Nigeria entirely without a plan to return.\r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to keep your company growing is to retain core talent. Here are two ways to keep your best employees on board.\r\n\r\n## 1. Pay above-average salaries\r\nOne of the most obvious ways to retain top workers is to offer better-than-average salaries and excellent benefits. This can lock employees in and encourage them to stick around for the pay and perks alone. You can also provide a specific retention bonus to give the incentive to stay with the company.\r\n\r\n## 2. Offer the ability to grow\r\nIt may be tempting to keep your best employees in the same position with the same duties. If they are performing above expectations, why change what they are doing? But employees who do the same tasks again and again can also grow complacent. If they ask for more or change things, entertain the idea seriously.\r\n\r\nIn wrapping up, two crucial questions to ask are why are they leaving in the first place? What can be done to prevent those that are still here from changing their minds? \r\n\r\nActioning the answers to these questions will create a more sustainable working environment. \r\n\r\nI'm Noah Olatoye, a Nigerian programmer and entrepreneur.

"{{first_name}}, here are this week\u2019s four links that are worth your time:\r\n\r\n1) **Website Security Checklists For Your Product:** Deploying a website on the Internet means exposing that website to hackers for attempts like port scanning, packet sniffing and data mining.\r\nYou might also get some legitimate traffic if you\u2019re lucky, but not if someone takes down or defaces your site first. Most of us know to look for the padlock icon when browsing to ensure a site is secure, but that only scratches the surface of what can be done to protect a web server.\r\n[https://instincthub.com/website-security-checklists-for-your-product/](https://instincthub.com/website-security-checklists-for-your-product/)\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n2) **Leadership Roles In Technology:**  One of the greatest gifts a leader can possess is the ability to lead and influence those around him through technology.\r\nThere are many ways to be a leader in technology, but regardless of which one you choose, your leadership style can affect how your team uses technology.\r\n [https://instincthub.com/leadership-roles-in-technology/](https://instincthub.com/leadership-roles-in-technology/)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n3) **How to create a circle with HTML and CSS[Video]:** In most cases, while we implement designs, we use boxes; sometimes, it is okay to use some nice circles while making designs. This short tutorial teaches how to create a fancy circle using HTML and CSS.\r\n[https://youtu.be/KlbSXcYfNuE](https://youtu.be/KlbSXcYfNuE)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n_Course of the week_\r\n<hr>\r\n4) **Introduction to Javascript:** The course aims to show you how to dynamically use JavaScript to manipulate web pages (also referred to as the

time:\r\n\r\n1) **Cybersecurity Incidents and How to Avoid Them?:** One of the greatest gifts a leader can possess is the ability to lead and influence those around him through technology.\r\nThere are many ways to be a leader in technology, but regardless of which one you choose, your leadership style can affect how your team uses technology.\r\n[https://instincthub.com/leadership-roles-in-technology/](https://instincthub.com/leadership-roles-in-technology/)\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n2) **Living Beyond Emotions:** This might be a bit

It is used for tracking every change by each contributor and helps prevent concurrent work from conflicting. \r\nThis course will get you started.

10 Serious Application Vulnerabilities", "slug": "owasp-top-10-serious-application-vulnerabilities", "description": "{{first_name}}, here are this week's four links that are worth your time:\r\n\r\n1) **OWASP Top 10 Serious Application Vulnerabilities:** About 90% of applications have serious vulnerabilities. OWASP, which regularly analyzes attacks and weaknesses on Web applications, has compiled the OWASP TOP-10 - the list of the most dangerous vulnerabilities. [https://instincthub.com/owasp-top-10-serious-application-vulnerabilities/](https://instincthub.com/owasp-top-10-serious-application-vulnerabilities/)\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n2) **The Fight Between Designers and Software Engineers:** In this post, I will share a bit about each job description, the cause of the constant disagreement and how it can be avoided. \r\n [https://instincthub.com/the-fight-between-designers-and-software-engineers/](https://instincthub.com/the-fight-between-designers-and-software-engineers/)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n3) ** How to Make Cloth Simulation with Marvelous Designer - Part 1 [Video]:** Create a piece of artwork that features Marvelous Designer made cloth based on ANY winter folklore story, from Krampus to the Barbegazi to Yuki-onna or any folklore you choose! Use the folktales as references for your piece, which can be cute, scary, or funny as long as it fits the winter folklore you have chosen! In this lesson, you will learn how to use the Marvelous Designer Application to model a dress.\r\n[https://youtu.be/h_5El1QBqgc](https://youtu.be/h_5El1QBqgc)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n_Course of the week_\r\n<hr>\r\n4) **Introduction To Python Programming Language:** Python is a natural programming language that is highly readable and simple to use and learn. It has clear and English-like syntax that allows the programmer to focus on the business logic rather than thinking about the language's nitty-gritty keywords. This course will help me understand how Python truly works.

show you how to create a responsive employee directory. To do this, I made the UI version in Adobe XD which will serve as the project guide throughout the short lesson.\r\n\r\nIn spicing things up on the web, we used HTML for the markup, CSS for the styling, and Javascript for the interactivity.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Aims and Objectives\r\n\r\nThis course aims to explain how to:\r\n\r\n1. Create web pages using graphics tools like Adobe XD.\r\n\r\n2. Create a mobile responsive design.\r\n\r\n3. Add interactivity with Javascript.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Learning Outcomes\r\n\r\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to understand:\r\n1. How a familiar user interface UI is created  \r\n\r\n2.  The concept of the mobile-first approach\r\n\r\n3. How to add a search feature in Javascript.\r\n\r\n[Enrol here](https://skills.instincthub.com/course/creating-employee-directory/)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n**Deadline: Wednesday 30th November 2022**\r\n\r\n### PS:\r\n\r\n- Code along with the instructor.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nGood luck.\r\nTech Diversity Team Lead\r\nAdisa Toheeb Kayode", "attach_file": null, "schedule": null, "timestamp": "2022-11-04T09:03:43.072000+01:00", "lead_contact_email": []}, {"id": 255, "email_from": "InstinctHub Weekly Digest <skills@instincthub.com>", "email_to": "all-contacts", "email_subject": "Cyber Security Threats and Controls", "slug": "cyber-security-threats-and-controls", "description": "{{first_name}}, here are this week's four links that are worth your time:\r\n\r\n1) **Cyber Security Threats and Controls:** Technological changes have been happening worldwide at an ever-increasing rate, including advancements in data capture devices, signal processing, communication capabilities, and automated process control systems like the Internet of Things.

time:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) **OTP(One-Time Passcode) Authentication:** If you\u2019ve ever used online banking, chances are you\u2019ve completed an OTP authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn OTP (One-Time Passcode) is a digital-generated code delivered via SMS, Email, or hardware token. The code is a verification form to protect against non-repudiation over your devices. [https://instincthub.com/otp-one-time-passcode-authentication/](https://instincthub.com/otp-one-time-passcode-authentication/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n2) **Employment Problem Why Do People Remain Jobless:** In subsequent years,  serious concerns have been about the constant inadequacy of employment opportunities in developing countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though developed countries have some unique challenges as well, however, the region getting the real hit are those that are still underdeveloped.\r\n\r\n [https://instincthub.com/employment-problem-why-do-people-remain-jobless/](https://instincthub.com/employment-problem-why-do-people-remain-jobless/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n3) ** All You Need to Know About Django - Python Framework [Video]:** \r\n\r\nDjango is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model\u2013template\u2013views architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation, an independent organization established in the US as a 501 non-profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this series, we will be taking you on a journey on how you can use the Python Django framework to create web applications.\r\n\r\n[https://youtu.be/fIYVXygQUr4](https://youtu.be/fIYVXygQUr4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n_Course of the week_\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n4) **Clipping Mask Image in Photoshop:** Clipping masks in Photoshop are a powerful way to control the visibility of a layer. A layer mask uses black and white to show and hide different parts of the layer. But a clipping mask uses one layer\u2019s content and transparency to control another\u2019s visibility. So to create a clipping mask, we need two layers.\r\n\r\n[https://skills.instincthub.com/course/clipping-mask-image-in-photoshop/](https://skills.instincthub.com/course/clipping-mask-image-in-photoshop/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n_Quote

often use products like Excel or Google Sheets.\r\n\r\nThose Apps work well except for one thing: you must stick to the rules.\r\n\r\nHere are reasons you should consider choosing code over prebuilt Apps.

With over 200 million people, 66.2 million Nigerians are out of jobs.\r\n\r\nTech Diversity by InstinctHub is structured to train 100,000 individuals each year and place 20% into direct jobs, creating wealth for families locked out of employment opportunities.\r\n[https://youtu.be/3JarYDSAUc8](https://youtu.be/3JarYDSAUc8)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n_Course of the week_\r\n<hr>\r\n4) **SQL for Beginners: ** SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

dust their certificates and look for ways to represent their portfolio better to attract the next ample opportunity.\r\nOf course, there is nothing wrong with this process at all; after all, we are all guilty of it. However, this post aims to make you realise you can immediately start dusting and cleaning up your resume. Most importantly, this post will showcase how employers can drive more growth by supporting continued learning culture.
