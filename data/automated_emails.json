Web development\r\nWeb development in simple English is the process of building and maintaining a website for the internet that is accessed through a web browser. \r\n\r\nAs a web developer, your job is mainly to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. \r\n\r\nIn web development there are two aspects of web development: \r\n\r\n- Front-end: This is the part of the web you see on the browser\r\n- Back-end: This is the part of the website you don't see; it deals with a lot of the logic and functionality. Remember the restaurant description in the book? \r\n\r\n### 2. Mobile Development \r\nThis is one of the last decade's most popular forms of coding. \r\n\r\nThis is because you can't do without apps on your mobile phone. Imagine having a phone, and there are no apps on it?? \r\n\r\nBoring right?? \r\n\r\nNow you know why these skills are relevant. \r\n\r\nThere are two main categories of mobile devices, which are: \r\niOS\r\nAndroid\r\n\r\nAre you excited about the boundless opportunities hovering around tech?\r\n\r\nIf your answer is yes, let us discuss how you can begin a tech career in 12 weeks.

Web developers always fall into one of these three categories: \r\n\r\n### 1. Front-end web developers: \r\nThink of these individuals as the people in charge of an eatery's open space. The customers can buy food and decide to eat there or request a takeaway. \r\n\r\nThe front-end developers work on the visual part of the website - the pages people interact with. They design the layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the site's interactivity.\r\n\r\n### 2. Back-end web developers: \r\nThink of these individuals as the people in charge of an eatery's kitchen. They do the behind-the-seen work to ensure the food is appealing, edible and delicious. \r\n\r\nBack-end developers make sure the users and business data are properly managed. They create structure and logic that communicate with the front-end and other third parties applications.\r\n\r\n### 3. Full-stack developer: \r\nThese individuals do the work of the chef in an eatery kitchen and that of the people in charge of the open space.\r\n\r\nThey do the work of both a back-end and front-end developer. These developers know and can implement all it takes to build an entire web application.  \r\n\r\nInterestingly {{first_name}}, you could be one of these great individuals! \r\n\r\nLet us discuss how you can begin a tech career in 12 weeks.

      "description": "Parenting and trying to put food on the table isn't easy! \r\n\r\nI would understand if you haven't read the free eBook \"What no school will ever teach your kid!\"\r\n\r\nAs a parent, setting up a big fight between your children and the economy is not always the right thing to do; they will likely lose the fight because they are at the Marcy of the economy. \r\n\r\nTwo young men grew up wanting to become doctors, so they went to a medical university and graduated with flying colours after eight years of intensive learning. \r\n\r\nBut due to the economy, getting a job was another battle they had to fight, but not for one of them, his name was Philip, at the age of 7, Philip was enrolled on a coding class by his parents, and he worked and master that skill over the years until he becomes a pro.\r\n\r\nPhilip has been creating an Application for managing hospital records ever since JSS3. \r\n\r\nAnd when Philip finally graduated, he marketed this App and Software to all the hospitals in the country. Eventually, almost all the hospitals signed up for his App then income began to flow in. \r\n\r\nNot only was Philip making millions from his creation, but all the hospitals in the country and abroad also wanted to work with him because he wasn't like all the other doctors; he had something different to offer to the medical world. \r\n\r\nThanks to Philip's parents!!!\r\n\r\nSo, as a parent, would you want to set a fight between your children and the economy, or would you want to make your child a winner before the war even starts?\r\n\r\nJust like how Philip's parents did for him, would you also want your child to beat the economy and create something that would give him millions in his profession?\r\n\r\nIf yes, then lets chat on how you can get started with: \r\n\r\n* Skills that school would never teach your kids, \r\n* Morden skills that will make them future billionaires.\r\n* Skills that would secure them brighter future. \r\n\r\n[Click here to schedule a free call now.](https://instincthub.com/calls/30/)",

      "description": "{{first_name}},\r\n\r\nThe richest man said his daughter can't marry a poor man.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA few years ago, there was a conference in the United States on investment and finance. One of the speakers was Elon Musk, and during the question and answer session, he was asked a question that had everyone laughing. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf he, the richest man in the world, could accept that his daughter marries a poor or modest man. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHis answer can change something in everyone.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHis response: First of all, understand that wealth does not mean having a fat bank account. Wealth is primarily the ability to create wealth.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExample: Someone who wins the lottery or gambling. Even if he wins 100 million is not a rich man: He is a poor man with a lot of money. That's the reason why 90% of the lottery millionaires become poor again after five years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou also have rich people who have no money.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExample: Most entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHEY are already on the road to wealth even though they have no money because they are developing their financial intelligence, and that is wealth. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow let us talk about you and your children!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI believe you want you and your kids to create wealth and be financially stable! \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf that's the case, the journey begins now.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you think you are not achieving so much as a parent or an individual, the right technology skills can help you. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour investment in you and your kids today determines the results you produce in future. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis season is the best time to get started with a straightforward career in tech. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is a flexible and engaging class with world-class instructors!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat you will learn:\r\n\r\nHow the internet works.\r\nMost used programming language.\r\nHow to solve problems with code \r\nPython Programming Language\r\nHow to turn business logic into machine code.\r\n \r\n\r\nWho can take this course?\r\n\r\nAnyone from the age of 7+, willing to become a problem solver with technology tools. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChat with us for free to know more.
